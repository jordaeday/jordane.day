  "content": "# The Compendium\n## Introduction\nWelcome to my compendium! This is a collection of my learnings, notes, and insights on various topics. I created this in order to keep track of, refine, and show off what I've been learning lately.\n## What is a compendium?\nA compendium is a collection of concise but detailed information about a particular subject. It's like a personal encyclopedia where I can store and organize my knowledge on different topics. The idea is to have a single place where I can easily access and review what I've learned.\n## Why create a compendium?\nI was mostly inspired by [this video](https://youtu.be/tQuliaVnrx0) which talks about the importance of having a personal knowledge base. A compendium also helps solidify learning by forcing the author to refine knowledge and summarize learning at several stages.\n## My Process\nMy process for adding information to this compendium is that I write down information in a physical notebook as I learn it (like summarizing what a professor says in a lecture). Then, I transfer that information to this compendium, refining and summarizing it again. This way, I have multiple stages of refinement which helps me solidify the knowledge and make it more concise and useful for future reference.",
