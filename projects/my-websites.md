My website has gone through a number or iterations as my skills improve and
I want to show off the new stuff I've learned.

This website has a Crystal backend and webserver, uses Caddy to serve HTTPS,
and utilizes a ECR system for a lot of the templating. Aside from Caddy, this
whole website has been created by hand by me, without the use of external libraries
or tools. I also learned how to host it on my Raspberry Pi at my house in Texas,
where it is hosted now!

# Iteration 1 
## 02/19/23 - 07-11-23
This first iteration was heavily inspired by the older days of the internet with
minimal html/css, which was great because I was still learning a lot then.

You can see the homepage [here](./websites/website1), or the full source code [here](https://github.com/jordaeday/jordane.day.v1/tree/main).

# Iteration 2 
## 07-11-23 - 08-20-23
The second iteration is where I was able to start exploring with more CSS,
creating more organized divs, and dabbling in some animations and stylesheets.
This iteration was mostly unfinished, as I wanted to show off a more modern and
professional webpage.

# Iteration 3 
## 08-20-23 - 09-27-24
With this iteration, I added more of a modern, clean style while adding
some more CSS elements, most notably having a universal style sheet and color sheet.
I also added a lot of backend aspects, most notably a Crystal program that renders
markdown files into the project page and into their own page.
