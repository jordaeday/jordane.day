__Edit 10/20/24:__ I've done some github reshuffling and a new iteration of my website. As such, many of the source code links have changed.

My website has gone through a number or iterations as my skills improve and
I want to show off the new stuff I've learned.

This website currently has a Express webserver, js backend, and utilizes Handlebars 
for a lot of the templating. It is currently hosted on my Raspberry Pi in Texas.

# Iteration 4 (current)
## 09-27-24 - present
This iteration mostly changed design elements, giving the site a more "techy" feel.
It was heavily inspired by [this](https://aubrey.rs/) website's old design. I also
added some 88x31 badges (if you would like to peer, reach out to me on Discord!).

You can see the homepage [here](./), or the full source code [here](https://github.com/jordaeday/jordane.day).

# Iteration 3 
## 08-20-23 - 09-27-24
With this iteration, I added more of a modern, clean style while adding
some more CSS elements, most notably having a universal style sheet and color sheet.
I also added a lot of backend aspects, most notably a Crystal program that renders
markdown files into the project page and into their own page.

You can see the homepage [here](./websites/website3), or the full source code [here](https://github.com/jordaeday/jordane.day/releases/tag/1.3.0). Additionally, the site is available [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20240913100814/https://jordane.day/) on the Wayback Machine.

# Iteration 2 
## 07-11-23 - 08-20-23
The second iteration is where I was able to start exploring with more CSS,
creating more organized divs, and dabbling in some animations and stylesheets.
This iteration was mostly unfinished, as I wanted to show off a more modern and
professional webpage.

You can see the homepage [here](./websites/website2), or the full source code [here](https://github.com/jordaeday/jordane.day/releases/tag/1.2.0).

# Iteration 1 
## 02/19/23 - 07-11-23
This first iteration was heavily inspired by the older days of the internet with
minimal html/css, which was great because I was still learning a lot then.

You can see the homepage [here](./websites/website1), or the full source code [here](https://github.com/jordaeday/jordane.day/releases/tag/1.1.0). Additionally, the site is available [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20230318144829/https://jordane.day/) on the Wayback Machine.
