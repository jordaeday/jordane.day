After discovering the 24a2 game engine, I wanted to mess around and make some simple
games with it. The premise of the 24a2 engine is that there is a 24x24 grid of dots
with limited functions.

# Gradient Slide Puzzle
I created two games. The first is a slide puzzle game, but instead of the tiles being
numbers or letters, they are different colors in a 4-color gradient.

The game is playable __[here](./gradient-slide/play)__!

# On-Off Switch Game
The second game is another puzzle game where you turn lights on and off, but every time
you click a light to turn it on or off, it also changes the state of the adjactent lights.
The goal is to get as many of the lights off as possible.


The game is playable __[here](./on-off/play)__!
