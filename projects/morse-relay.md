This project was a final project for CICS 256, a class focused on making projects with hardware components.
For my group's final project, we created a program that would allow the user to give it input text,
and the program would then convert it into morse code and transmit that message via a series of beeps from
our arduino chip.

This project, and espectially this class, gave me valuable information on how hardware and electricity works,
how to incorporate hardware into software projects, how to use an Arduino, and how to use the Processing library.
