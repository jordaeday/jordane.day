Inspired by the internet phenomenon of a "long furby," a Furby toy that has had its neck extended,
I created a long furby of my own on wheels for a hackathon project at Hack UMass X. This being
my first hackathon, I wanted to work with my hands and create something material.

This project ended up winning "Best Mechanical Hack" due to including a mechanical aspect (the car)
and utilizing a sewing machine to hand-create the furby from scratch, something that no other group did.
