This project takes in some incomplete sudoku puzzles (as seen in the <a href="https://github.com/jordaeday/sudoku-solver/blob/main/sudoku.txt">sudoku.txt file</a> on the GitHub page), then recursively solves the puzzles and outputs the completed puzzle.

I love playing sudoku, so this was a great early project to do that combines my love and knowledge of sudoku with my programming skills. While this project doesn't feel impressive to me any more, I think it really shows how far I've come in terms of my skills.
