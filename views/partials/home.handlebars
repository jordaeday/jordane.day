    Hiii! My name is Jordan Day, and I am currently a student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
    I am majoring in computer science and minoring in linguistics. I enjoy doing software development, web development,
    and dabbling in hackathons and cybersecurity. On weekends or in my free time, you can find me playing video games,
    coding, or at a debate tournament. 
    <br> <br>
    I am an incoming Software Developer Intern at Amazon for the summer of 2025!
